# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Here are a couple ways to start!

## 🤝Common ways to contribute
- 🐞 Found a bug? Go to the repository's issue page and submit a report using the bug template.
- 📝 Want to improve or create documentation to help others learn how to use the repo? Fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
- 🙋‍♀️ Just want to share some ideas? Create an issue, feel free to use the feature request template for guidance. Or share it in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mGKVVpxTPr)

## 🔍 Looking at issues
1. Look at the issues page of the repo and browse for issues you are interested working on
2. Comment and assign yourself to the issue that you want to take on
3. Work on the issue and submit a pull request (or whatever deliverable was associated with the issue)
4. Wait for the project maintainer to review (please be patient)

If you can no longer finish the issue, no worries! Just unassign yourself from the issue
