# Waste Watcher Adafruit IO

Waste Watcher is an IoT based sensor module to help keep track of waste data metrics with real-time bin fullness data and waste images. This is intended to help quantify waste and promote actionable solutions to lower the amount of waste people throw away. This project is a continuation of [waste_watcher](https://github.com/zotbins/waste_watcher). This repo, in particular, uses [Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com/), an off-the-shelf IoT platform that is simple to use and has a very supportive community. This project is aimed to be more user-friendly as it doesn't require you to setup/host your own server. Adafruit IO is also free to use  F O R E V E R ╰(*°▽°*)╯, according to their [website](https://io.adafruit.com/). 

## How this Project Started
I wanted a way to keep track of how much waste I was generating just to be more environmentally conscious. So I created this project as an automated way to help keep track of waste accumulation through fullness measurements while also taking pictures of the objects thrown away.
